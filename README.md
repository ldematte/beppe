BePPe - Bezier Patch Editor

## Introduction: what is this code and why is it here? ##

A new year has just begun, and as many of you I made a new year's resolution. Partly, it was inspired by a project I followed last year (code52: a new open source application every week, or so). I am far less ambitious, but for a long time I wanted to participate to the OSS community. It is time to begin; but where to begin? From what I already have, of course.  I was browsing through my backups and found so many forgotten projects. Being a software developer by profession, great part of the code I wrote belongs to my employer, of course. But there are still some small projects I did in my free time, during vacations, or some projects I did back at the University which could still be useful, or at least interesting. 
Mind you: as many developers, initially I didnâ€™t want to share this old code. Who among us is happy with the code he/she wrote years ago? Developers in general, I believe, are perfectionists. But the alternative was to take the code and rewrite it, or leave it sit in my backup. I am sure you will excuse and understand style and design issues; after all, it is code written between five and 10 years ago!

## This project ##

This is a simple 4-view 3D editor, which lets you design 3D models made of bezier patches. I wrote this editor with my classmate Alessandro Santuari for a class on the mathematical foundations of 3D graphics. It should compile and work both under Windows and Linux; we coded it under Visual C++ 5 and later 6 (Yes, Intellisense was working most of the time! :) )
